# WarrantyWatch
The miner warranty checker. WarrantyWatch tackles a question: “Is this miner still under manufacturer warranty or not?” It lets users upload a list of serial numbers and receive a report: which units are still covered, when coverage expires, and which are out of warranty. It is useful for hosting companies or and mining farm operators.
